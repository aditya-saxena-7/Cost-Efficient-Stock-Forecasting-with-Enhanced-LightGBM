### Cost Awareness: Optimizing Stock Predictions üìäüí°

#### What is Cost Awareness? ü§î
Cost awareness in stock prediction refers to the model's sensitivity to different types of prediction errors, particularly focusing on minimizing false-positive errors. A false-positive error in stock trading is when the model predicts a stock price will go up (a "buy" signal), but it doesn't, leading to a potential loss.

- **Example**: Imagine you receive a false alarm for a fire in your house. You evacuate and call the fire department, only to find out there was no fire. This false alarm wasted resources and time. Similarly, a false-positive prediction in stock trading leads to unnecessary investments and potential losses. üö´üî•

#### Traditional Evaluation Metrics üìè

Traditional stock prediction models are evaluated using standard binary classification metrics:
1. **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.
   - **Formula**: Accuracy = TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN
   - **Example**: If you correctly predict 80 out of 100 stock movements, your accuracy is 80%. üéØ

2. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positive and false negative predictions.
   - **Formula**: Recall = TP / TP + FN
   - **Example**: If you correctly predict 70 out of 100 actual positive movements, your recall is 70%. üîç

3. **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positive and false positive predictions.
   - **Formula**: Precision = TP / TP + FP
   - **Example**: If 60 out of 100 predicted positive movements are actually positive, your precision is 60%. üßê

4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   - **Formula**: F1 = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)
   - **Example**: If both precision and recall are 75%, the F1 score is also 75%. üîÑ

#### Confusion Matrix üìä

The confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model. It has four components:
- **True Positive (TP)**: Correctly predicted positive cases.
- **True Negative (TN)**: Correctly predicted negative cases.
- **False Positive (FP)**: Incorrectly predicted positive cases (Type I error).
- **False Negative (FN)**: Incorrectly predicted negative cases (Type II error).

**Table: Confusion Matrix**
|                | Predicted Negative | Predicted Positive |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Actual Negative| True Negative (TN) | False Positive (FP)|
| Actual Positive| False Negative (FN)| True Positive (TP) |

#### Cost Awareness in Model Evaluation üí∏

In stock prediction, not all errors have the same cost. A false-positive error (FP) can lead to direct financial loss, while a false-negative error (FN) results in missed profit opportunities but doesn't incur a direct loss. Hence, it's crucial to design the model to minimize false-positive errors.

- **Example**: If a model incorrectly signals a buy (FP) and the stock doesn't rise, the investor loses money. However, if the model misses a buy signal (FN), the investor only misses a profit opportunity but doesn't lose money. üè¶‚û°Ô∏èüö´üìâ

#### Cost Matrix üìä‚û°Ô∏èüí∞

A cost matrix quantifies the financial implications of different prediction errors. The cost matrix for a binary classification model in this context can be structured as:

**Table: Cost Matrix**
|                | Predicted Negative | Predicted Positive |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Actual Negative| 0                  | \(fp\_Amt\)        |
| Actual Positive| \(fn\_Amt\)        | 0                  |

- **True Positive (TP) and True Negative (TN) costs** are considered zero since they don't incur any loss.
- **False Positive (FP) cost (\(fp\_Amt\))**: The financial loss incurred due to a false buy signal.
- **False Negative (FN) cost (\(fn\_Amt\))**: The missed profit opportunity due to a false sell signal.

**Algorithm: Calculating Cost Matrix**
1. Initialize investment amount.
2. Calculate transaction amounts for each prediction.
3. Compute service charges and stamp duties.
4. Determine false-positive and false-negative costs.
5. Aggregate individual costs to get the total cost.

### Explanation of Algorithm 2: Calculate Cost Matrix üìäüí∏

This algorithm is designed to calculate the cost matrix for evaluating the financial implications of false-positive and false-negative predictions in a stock trading model. Let's break down the algorithm step-by-step, explaining the purpose and each part of the process.

#### Purpose:
The algorithm calculates the financial costs associated with false-positive (FP) and false-negative (FN) predictions for a set of stock transactions. It helps in understanding the potential losses due to incorrect predictions.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   init buy_rate, sell_rate, stamp duty
   money = money_init
   cost_df = test_df
   ```
   - Initialize the buy rate, sell rate, and stamp duty.
   - Set the initial amount of money (`money`) to `money_init`.
   - Copy the test data (`test_df`) to `cost_df` for further processing.

2. **Loop Through Each Row of `cost_df`**:
   ```python
   for all (i, row) ‚àà cost_df do
   ```
   - Iterate through each row of the `cost_df` to calculate the costs for each stock.

3. **Calculate Rates**:
   ```python
   fp_rate = fabs(row[buy_price] ‚àí row[sell_price])
   fn_rate = fp_rate
   ```
   - Calculate the false-positive rate (`fp_rate`) as the absolute difference between the buy price and the sell price.
   - Set the false-negative rate (`fn_rate`) to be equal to the false-positive rate.

4. **Calculate Transaction Numbers and Amounts**:
   ```python
   tran_num = (money / row[buy_price]) // 100
   buy_money = tran_num * row[buy_price]
   sell_money = tran_num * row[sell_price]
   ```
   - Determine the number of transactions (`tran_num`) that can be made with the available money.
   - Calculate the total amount spent on buying stocks (`buy_money`).
   - Calculate the total amount received from selling stocks (`sell_money`).

5. **Calculate Service Charges and Stamp Duty**:
   ```python
   service_change = buy_money * buy_rate + sell_money * sell_rate
   stamp_duty = stamp_duty * sell_money
   ```
   - Calculate the total service charge (`service_change`) based on the buy and sell amounts and their respective rates.
   - Calculate the stamp duty (`stamp_duty`) based on the sell amount.

6. **Calculate False-Positive and False-Negative Costs**:
   ```python
   fp_Amt[i] = fp_rate * tran_num + service_change + stamp_duty
   fn_Amt[i] = fn_rate * tran_num ‚àí service_change ‚àí stamp_duty
   ```
   - Compute the false-positive cost (`fp_Amt`) for the current row.
   - Compute the false-negative cost (`fn_Amt`) for the current row.

7. **Assign Calculated Costs to Cost Matrix**:
   ```python
   cost_mat[:, 0] = fp_Amt
   cost_mat[:, 1] = fn_Amt
   cost_mat[:, 2] = 0.0
   cost_mat[:, 3] = 0.0
   ```
   - Assign the calculated false-positive costs to the first column of the cost matrix.
   - Assign the calculated false-negative costs to the second column of the cost matrix.
   - Set the third and fourth columns of the cost matrix to zero.

8. **Return the Cost Matrix**:
   ```python
   return cost_mat
   ```
   - Return the final cost matrix containing the calculated costs.

### Understanding LightGBM Algorithm for Minimizing False-Positive Errors in Stock Prediction

#### Introducing Cost Awareness
**Step:** Cost Awareness Adjustment
- The core innovation is integrating cost awareness to reduce false-positive errors (predicting a "buy" when the price won't rise).
- A cost matrix is developed to assign higher penalties to false-positive errors compared to false-negative errors.

**Example:**
- If the model predicts a stock will rise and it doesn‚Äôt (false positive), the financial cost is calculated and heavily penalized compared to missing a rise (false negative).

#### 4. Implementing the Cost Matrix in LightGBM
**Step:** Adjusting LightGBM Parameters for Cost Sensitivity
- The `scale_pos_weight` parameter in LightGBM is tuned using Optuna to make the model more sensitive to false-positive errors.
- The cost matrix guides this adjustment by assigning a higher cost to false-positive errors, making the model more cautious about generating "buy" signals without strong evidence.

**Example:**
- If `scale_pos_weight` is set to a high value, LightGBM will weigh false positives more heavily during training, reducing their occurrence in the final model.

#### 5. Model Evaluation
**Step:** Model Performance Evaluation
- Performance is measured using precision, F0.5 score (which prioritizes precision over recall), rate of return, annualized return, and risk indicators like Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio.

**Example:**
- If the model achieves a precision of 58.65% and an F0.5 score of 57.94%, it indicates a high accuracy in predicting profitable trades while minimizing false positives.

### Detailed Example

Let's consider a practical example to illustrate how minimizing false positives works:

1. **Data Input:**
   - Daily stock prices for the past 10 years.
   - Technical indicators such as moving averages, momentum, and volatility.

2. **Training the Model:**
   - LightGBM is trained on this data with features such as the 10-day moving average, 14-day RSI (Relative Strength Index), and daily closing prices.
   - Hyperparameters are optimized using Optuna.

3. **Cost Matrix Implementation:**
   - Define the cost of false positives (`fp_Amt`) and false negatives (`fn_Amt`).
   - `fp_Amt` could be set to $1000 (cost of wrong "buy" signals), and `fn_Amt` to $500 (cost of missed "buy" signals).

4. **Adjusting LightGBM:**
   - The `scale_pos_weight` parameter is adjusted to make the model more sensitive to false positives. For instance, if initially set to 1 (no bias), it might be increased to 5 to reduce false positives significantly.

5. **Model Prediction:**
   - The model predicts stock prices for the next day. It only issues a "buy" signal if the predicted probability of price increase is very high, reducing the chances of false positives.
   - If the model predicts a 70% probability of price increase, it evaluates the potential cost.
If the cost of a false positive (buying and the price doesn‚Äôt rise) is high, the model might avoid issuing a "buy" signal unless the probability is higher, say 85%.

Let's dive deeper into how the cost matrix works, how `fp_Amt`, `fn_Amt`, and `scale_pos_weight` are calculated, and the flow of the algorithm to understand how it adjusts to minimize false positives.

### Cost Matrix and Algorithm Flow

#### 1. Defining Cost Matrix Values (`fp_Amt` and `fn_Amt`)

The cost matrix is central to making the LightGBM model cost-aware. The cost matrix helps the model focus more on avoiding false positives by assigning higher penalties to them. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. **Data Preparation and Labeling:**
   - The stock data is labeled for binary classification (buy/sell).
   - If the next day's closing price is higher than today's, the label is 1 (buy); otherwise, it's 0 (sell).

2. **Calculating Costs:**
   - The cost of a false positive (`fp_Amt`) is the financial loss incurred if the model incorrectly predicts a price increase (buy signal).
   - The cost of a false negative (`fn_Amt`) is the opportunity cost of not buying a stock that increases in price.

**Example Calculation:**
   - **False Positive (`fp_Amt`):** Assume you buy 100 shares at $50 each, expecting the price to go up. If the price drops to $45, the loss per share is $5. So, `fp_Amt = 100 * $5 = $500`.
   - **False Negative (`fn_Amt`):** If you don't buy 100 shares at $50 each, and the price goes up to $55, the missed gain per share is $5. So, `fn_Amt = 100 * $5 = $500`.

#### 2. Integrating Cost Awareness into LightGBM

To integrate cost awareness, the algorithm adjusts the `scale_pos_weight` parameter. This parameter helps balance the class distribution and makes the model more sensitive to the class with higher cost (false positives in this case).

### Algorithm Flow

1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Prepare the features (technical indicators, OHLC prices, etc.) and label the data.

2. **Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna:**
   - Optimize hyperparameters using time-series cross-validation.
   - Initially, `scale_pos_weight` might be set to balance the classes without considering cost.

3. **Cost Awareness Adjustment:**
   - **Initialize Cost Matrix:**
     ```python
     cost_matrix = [[0, fp_Amt],
                    [fn_Amt, 0]]
     ```

   - **Adjusting `scale_pos_weight`:**
     - Use the cost matrix to adjust `scale_pos_weight`. This weight increases the importance of reducing false positives by increasing the weight for positive class (buy signal).

Certainly! Let's delve into the mathematical rationale behind adjusting the `scale_pos_weight` using a cost matrix to reduce false positives in the LightGBM model.

### Understanding `scale_pos_weight`

The `scale_pos_weight` parameter in LightGBM adjusts the weight of positive samples to balance the classes. By increasing this weight, the algorithm penalizes errors on the positive class more heavily, which in turn reduces the likelihood of false positives.

### Cost Matrix and `scale_pos_weight`

A cost matrix assigns different penalties to different types of classification errors. For stock prediction:
- **False Positive (FP)**: Predicting a price increase (buy signal) when the price does not increase.
- **False Negative (FN)**: Not predicting a price increase (missed buy signal).

### Example Cost Matrix
Consider the following cost matrix:

     ```python
     cost_matrix = [[0, fp_Amt],
                    [fn_Amt, 0]]
     ```

Here, `fp_Amt` is the financial loss due to a false positive, and `fn_Amt` is the opportunity cost due to a false negative.

### Calculating `scale_pos_weight`

To adjust `scale_pos_weight` using the cost matrix, you need to derive a weight that reflects the relative costs of false positives and false negatives. The idea is to increase the weight of the positive class based on the cost ratio.

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Define Costs:**
   - \( fp\_Amt \) = Cost of a false positive.
   - \( fn\_Amt \) = Cost of a false negative.

2. **Calculate Cost Ratio:**
   - The ratio of false positive cost to false negative cost:
   \[
   \text{Cost Ratio} = \frac{fp\_Amt}{fn\_Amt}
   \]

3. **Set `scale_pos_weight`:**
   - The `scale_pos_weight` parameter is then adjusted according to this cost ratio to ensure the model penalizes false positives more heavily.
   \[
   \text{scale\_pos\_weight} = \text{Cost Ratio}
   \]

### Example Calculation

Let's assume:
- \( fp\_Amt = 1000 \) (Cost of a false positive)
- \( fn\_Amt = 200 \) (Cost of a false negative)

1. **Calculate Cost Ratio:**
   \[
   \text{Cost Ratio} = \frac{1000}{200} = 5
   \]

2. **Set `scale_pos_weight`:**
   \[
   \text{scale\_pos\_weight} = 5
   \]

This means that the model will treat false positives as being 5 times more costly than false negatives, thereby increasing the weight for the positive class (buy signal).

### Implementation in LightGBM

When setting up the LightGBM model, you incorporate this calculated `scale_pos_weight`:

```python
from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier

model = LGBMClassifier(scale_pos_weight=5,  # Adjusted weight
                       num_leaves=31,
                       feature_fraction=0.8,
                       bagging_fraction=0.8,
                       bagging_freq=5)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_valid, y_valid)], early_stopping_rounds=10)
```

### Understanding the Logic Behind `fp_Amt` and `fn_Amt` in Stock Prediction

#### What Are `fp_Amt` and `fn_Amt`?

- **`fp_Amt` (False Positive Amount):** This is the financial loss incurred when the model incorrectly predicts a stock price will go up (a "buy" signal), but it doesn't. Essentially, it's the cost of making a bad investment.
  
- **`fn_Amt` (False Negative Amount):** This is the opportunity cost when the model fails to predict a stock price increase (a "sell" signal) but the price does go up. It's the cost of missing out on a potential profit.

#### How Are `fp_Amt` and `fn_Amt` Calculated?

**Example Calculation:**

1. **Data Inputs:**
   - **Buy Price:** Price at which you would buy the stock.
   - **Sell Price:** Price at which you would sell the stock.
   - **Number of Shares:** Number of shares you are trading.
   - **Buy Rate:** Transaction fee for buying the stock.
   - **Sell Rate:** Transaction fee for selling the stock.
   - **Stamp Duty:** Tax applied on stock transactions.

2. **Calculate Amounts for False Positive:**
   - When you buy a stock at the buy price expecting it to go up, but it doesn't and instead, you sell it at a lower price.
   - Example: Buy 100 shares at $50 each, sell them at $45 each.
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - Loss per share: $50 (buy price) - $45 (sell price) = $5
     - Total Loss: 100 shares * $5 = $500
     - Add transaction fees and taxes to this loss to get `fp_Amt`.

3. **Calculate Amounts for False Negative:**
   - When you don't buy a stock at the buy price, missing out on the chance to sell it at a higher price.
   - Example: Buy 100 shares at $50 each, sell them at $55 each.
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - Missed profit per share: $55 (sell price) - $50 (buy price) = $5
     - Total Missed Profit: 100 shares * $5 = $500
     - Subtract transaction fees and taxes to get `fn_Amt`.

### Understanding the Loss Function in LightGBM

LightGBM, like other gradient boosting frameworks, optimizes a loss function during training. For binary classification, a common loss function is the binary cross-entropy (logistic loss).

#### Binary Cross-Entropy Loss Function:

The binary cross-entropy loss for a single prediction is given by:

\[ \text{Loss} = -y \log(p) - (1 - y) \log(1 - p) \]

where:
- \( y \) is the actual label (1 for positive, 0 for negative).
- \( p \) is the predicted probability of the positive class.

### Incorporating `scale_pos_weight`

The `scale_pos_weight` parameter adjusts the loss function to give different weights to positive and negative classes. This is useful when the cost of misclassification is different for the two classes.

#### Modified Loss Function:

With `scale_pos_weight`, the loss function for each instance becomes:

\[ \text{Loss} = -w_y \cdot y \log(p) - w_{1-y} \cdot (1 - y) \log(1 - p) \]

where:
- \( w_y \) is the weight for the positive class.
- \( w_{1-y} \) is the weight for the negative class.

For binary classification with `scale_pos_weight`, we typically adjust the weight for the positive class. Let's denote `scale_pos_weight` as \( w_p \).

- For positive class (y=1): \( w_y = w_p \)
- For negative class (y=0): \( w_{1-y} = 1 \)

Thus, the modified loss function becomes:

\[ \text{Loss} = -w_p \cdot y \log(p) - (1 - y) \log(1 - p) \]

### Example Calculation

#### Without `scale_pos_weight`:

Consider the following example:

- Actual label (\( y \)): 1 (positive class)
- Predicted probability (\( p \)): 0.7

The binary cross-entropy loss without any weights is:

\[ \text{Loss} = -1 \cdot \log(0.7) - (1 - 1) \cdot \log(1 - 0.7) \]
\[ \text{Loss} = -\log(0.7) \approx 0.3567 \]

#### With `scale_pos_weight`:

Suppose we set `scale_pos_weight` \( w_p = 5 \):

The modified loss function is:

\[ \text{Loss} = -5 \cdot 1 \cdot \log(0.7) - (1 - 1) \cdot \log(1 - 0.7) \]
\[ \text{Loss} = -5 \cdot \log(0.7) \approx 5 \cdot 0.3567 = 1.7835 \]

### Impact on Model Training

By increasing the weight for the positive class, the loss for false positives becomes larger. This higher penalty influences the model during training:

1. **Gradient Boosting Process:**
   - LightGBM builds trees to minimize the overall loss function.
   - With a higher penalty for false positives, the model will focus more on correctly predicting the positive class to minimize the loss.

2. **Decision Boundary Adjustment:**
   - The model adjusts its decision boundary to reduce the number of false positives.
   - In practice, this means the model will require stronger evidence to classify an instance as positive (i.e., "buy" signal).

### Detailed Example with `scale_pos_weight`

Let's go through a more detailed example with multiple predictions to see the impact of `scale_pos_weight`.

#### Data:

| Instance | Actual Label (y) | Predicted Probability (p) | Log Loss Without Weight | Log Loss With Weight (scale_pos_weight = 5) |
|----------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1        | 1                | 0.9                       | -log(0.9) ‚âà 0.105       | -5 * log(0.9) ‚âà 0.525                      |
| 2        | 0                | 0.1                       | -log(0.9) ‚âà 0.105       | -log(0.9) ‚âà 0.105                          |
| 3        | 1                | 0.7                       | -log(0.7) ‚âà 0.357       | -5 * log(0.7) ‚âà 1.785                      |
| 4        | 0                | 0.2                       | -log(0.8) ‚âà 0.223       | -log(0.8) ‚âà 0.223                          |
| 5        | 1                | 0.4                       | -log(0.4) ‚âà 0.916       | -5 * log(0.4) ‚âà 4.580                      |

#### Summarizing the Losses:

**Without Weight:**

\[ \text{Total Loss} = 0.105 + 0.105 + 0.357 + 0.223 + 0.916 = 1.706 \]

**With Weight (scale_pos_weight = 5):**

\[ \text{Total Loss} = 0.525 + 0.105 + 1.785 + 0.223 + 4.580 = 7.218 \]

### Analysis

- **Without `scale_pos_weight`:**
  - The model treats all errors equally.
  - The total loss is lower because false positives are not penalized heavily.

- **With `scale_pos_weight`:**
  - The model places more importance on minimizing false positives.
  - The total loss is higher for false positives due to the increased weight.

### Conclusion

By increasing the `scale_pos_weight`, the LightGBM model modifies the loss function to penalize false positives more heavily. This encourages the model to be more conservative in predicting the positive class (i.e., "buy" signals) unless there is strong evidence, thereby reducing the number of costly false-positive errors.

### Range of Entropy in Weighted Cases

In non-weighted cases, the binary cross-entropy loss typically ranges between 0 and 1 for individual predictions. However, in weighted cases, the range of the entropy loss is affected by the weighting factor.

#### Non-Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy:

\[ \text{Loss} = -y \log(p) - (1 - y) \log(1 - p) \]

For a single prediction:
- If \( y = 1 \) and \( p = 0.5 \), the loss is \(-\log(0.5) = 0.693\).
- If \( y = 0 \) and \( p = 0.5 \), the loss is also \(-\log(0.5) = 0.693\).

The loss for individual predictions ranges between 0 (for perfect predictions) and \(\infty\) (for very confident but wrong predictions), though in practical applications, it is usually between 0 and a small number greater than 1.

#### Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy:

\[ \text{Loss} = -w_y \cdot y \log(p) - w_{1-y} \cdot (1 - y) \log(1 - p) \]

Here, the weights \( w_y \) and \( w_{1-y} \) modify the loss values:

- When \( y = 1 \) and the weight \( w_y = w_p \):
  \[ \text{Loss} = -w_p \log(p) \]
- When \( y = 0 \) and the weight \( w_{1-y} = 1 \):
  \[ \text{Loss} = -\log(1 - p) \]

The range of the weighted loss depends on the value of \( w_p \):
- The minimum loss is still 0 (for perfect predictions).
- The maximum loss can be much higher than 1, depending on the value of \( w_p \).

For example, if \( w_p = 5 \) and the prediction is incorrect with \( p = 0.1 \) when \( y = 1 \):
\[ \text{Loss} = -5 \log(0.1) \approx 11.51 \]

### High Entropy Loss: Interpretation and Model Objective

#### High Entropy Loss:

A high entropy loss indicates that the model's predictions are not aligning well with the actual labels, particularly when the model is confident in its incorrect predictions. In the context of stock predictions with weighted loss:

- **High Weighted Loss:** Indicates the model is making costly mistakes (e.g., predicting a "buy" signal when it should not have, leading to a significant financial loss).
- **Focus on Reducing False Positives:** The weighted loss penalizes false positives more heavily, making the model cautious in issuing "buy" signals.

#### Model Objective:

The primary objective of the model in this context is to minimize the overall weighted binary cross-entropy loss. By doing so, the model aims to:

1. **Reduce False Positives:** Since false positives are more costly, the high penalty encourages the model to be more accurate in predicting "buy" signals.
2. **Balance Prediction Quality:** While reducing false positives, the model also aims to maintain a good level of accuracy for "sell" signals, ensuring a balanced performance.
3. **Optimize Financial Outcomes:** By focusing on minimizing the most costly errors, the model helps in making more cost-efficient stock predictions, thereby improving overall financial returns.
