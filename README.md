### Abstract
The abstract of my paper provides a summary of the research and its key findings. Here's a breakdown of the abstract in simple terms:

#### Key Points:
- **Machine Learning in Stock Prediction**: The research focuses on using machine learning to predict stock prices, which is a hot topic in finance and academia. 🌟
- **LightGBM Model**: We used a specific machine learning model called LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) for short-term stock investment. 📊
- **Cost Awareness**: The model is designed to be aware of costs, especially false-positive errors, which can lead to 'fake chances' and investment losses. 💸
- **Technical Indicators**: Various technical indicators are selected to improve the reliability of the prediction. 📈
- **Performance Comparison**: Our model is compared with other popular models like XGBoost and Random Forest, and it shows better accuracy, profitability, and risk control. 🏆

#### Terminologies Explained:
1. **Machine Learning (ML)**: A branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions. Example: Predicting the weather based on historical data. 🤖
2. **Stock Prediction**: Forecasting future stock prices using various data points and algorithms. Example: Predicting that a stock price will go up tomorrow based on today's market trends. 📉📈
3. **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**: A machine learning model known for its efficiency and high performance in processing large datasets. Example: Sorting your photo library quickly and accurately. 📸➡️📂
4. **False-Positive Error**: When the model incorrectly predicts a positive outcome, such as predicting a stock price will rise when it won't. Example: A smoke detector going off when there's no fire. 🚫🔥
5. **Technical Indicators**: Metrics used to analyze and predict stock price movements. Example: Moving Averages, which smooth out price data to identify trends. 📊
6. **XGBoost and Random Forest**: Other popular machine learning models used for comparison. Example: Competing cars in a race to see which is the fastest. 🚗🏁
